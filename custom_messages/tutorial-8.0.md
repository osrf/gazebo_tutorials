# Introduction

Gazebo-classic topics communicate through Google protobuf messages. There is an
extensive
[list](http://osrf-distributions.s3.amazonaws.com/gazebo/msg-api/dev/classes.html)
of message types provided by Gazebo, for use with subscribing and publishing
Gazebo-classic topics. However, there are many situations where you want to build
your own.

This tutorial is an example of how to create your own custom messages, and
how to subscribe and publish them in a Gazebo-classic plug-in.

## About this code

At the end of this project you should have a plug-in that can create a 2D
collision map of a Gazebo-classic World. The plug-in will rasterize a world in
Gazebo-classic use a RayShape to do ray intersection below this grid. It will
publish the created image to a custom topic and output to a file. The source
code for this plug-in lives at
[GitHub](https://github.com/osrf/collision_map_creator_plugin).

Feel free to submit issues or pull-requests for improvements. The original
author of the code is Stephen Brawner.

You can download the source code using git:

~~~
git clone https://github.com/osrf/collision_map_creator_plugin
~~~

or copy and paste the code into files as instructed below.

## Writing your own message

Writing your own message is great if it's too difficult to cram the
subscriber/publisher message into one of Gazebo's already available message
types. Furthermore, you can combine many different message types if you want
to make complicated messages. Gazebo-classic contains a library of messages already.
The installed messages can be found in
/usr/include/gazebo-<YOUR_GAZEBO_VERSION>/gazebo/msgs/proto for debian
installs.  This tutorial makes use of the [vector2d.proto
message](https://github.com/osrf/gazebo/blob/gazebo8/gazebo/msgs/vector2d.proto).

You can see how a custom message is declared by looking into
`~/collision_map_creator_plugin/msgs/collision_map_request.proto`.

~~~
package collision_map_creator_msgs.msgs;
import "vector2d.proto";

message CollisionMapRequest
{
  required gazebo.msgs.Vector2d   upperLeft  = 1;
  required gazebo.msgs.Vector2d   upperRight = 2;
  required gazebo.msgs.Vector2d   lowerRight = 3;
  required gazebo.msgs.Vector2d   lowerLeft  = 4;
  required double                 height     = 5;
  required double                 resolution = 6;
  optional string                 filename   = 7 [default = ""];
  optional int32                  threshold  = 8 [default = 255];
}
~~~

### Code explained ###

First we declare the namespace this message lives in, with the `package`
declaration.

~~~
package collision_map_creator_msgs.msgs;
~~~

We make use of gazebo's vector2d, so we must include that (the location of the messages will be taken care of in CMakeLists.txt).

~~~
import "vector2d.proto";
~~~

This is the actual message construct.

~~~
message CollisionMapRequest
{
}
~~~

Declare each message field with:

~~~
["optional"/"required"] [field type] [field name] = [enum];
~~~

Each enum must be a unique number. Note also that the full package name must
be used to specify external messages (gazebo.msgs in our case).

~~~
  required gazebo.msgs.Vector2d   upperLeft  = 1;
  required gazebo.msgs.Vector2d   upperRight = 2;
  required gazebo.msgs.Vector2d   lowerRight = 3;
  required gazebo.msgs.Vector2d   lowerLeft  = 4;
  required double                 height     = 5;
  required double                 resolution = 6;
~~~

Messages can contain optional fields. Optional fields can contain default
values if they aren't specified. This is an example of how to do that.

~~~
  optional string filename   = 7 [default = ""];
  optional int32  threshold  = 8 [default = 255];
~~~

## CMakeLists for custom messages

In this tutorial we also provide the
`~/collision_map_creator/msgs/CMakeLists.txt` that will generate your C++
code from your protobuf message definition:

### Code explained

Tells CMake to include the Protobuf package

~~~
find_package(Protobuf REQUIRED)
~~~

This section finds where the messages are installed. The message files are
stored in `/usr/include/gazebo-<YOUR_GAZEBO_VERSION>/gazebo/msgs/proto` for
debian installs, but the user may have installed elsewhere. This code
searches for the `gazebo-X.X` folder and sets the `PROTOBUF_IMPORT_DIRS`
variable accordingly. The `PROTOBUF_IMPORT_DIRS` specifies the location of
extra message files.

~~~
set(PROTOBUF_IMPORT_DIRS)
foreach(ITR ${GAZEBO_INCLUDE_DIRS})
  if(ITR MATCHES ".*gazebo-[0-9.]+$")
    set(PROTOBUF_IMPORT_DIRS "${ITR}/gazebo/msgs/proto")
  endif()
endforeach()
~~~

Creates a list called `msgs` with the vector2d.proto message, its
dependencies `time.proto` and `header.proto`, and the
`collision_map_request.proto` message.

~~~
set (msgs
  collision_map_request.proto
  ${PROTOBUF_IMPORT_DIRS}/vector2d.proto
  ${PROTOBUF_IMPORT_DIRS}/header.proto
  ${PROTOBUF_IMPORT_DIRS}/time.proto
)
~~~

Build the necessary C++ headers and source files for our messages.

~~~
PROTOBUF_GENERATE_CPP(PROTO_SRCS PROTO_HDRS ${msgs})
~~~

Add this message library so that we can link to it from other projects. The
library name needs to be the same as the library name specified in the other
`CMakeLists.txt` further below.

~~~
add_library(collision_map_creator_msgs SHARED ${PROTO_SRCS})
target_link_libraries(collision_map_creator_msgs ${PROTOBUF_LIBRARY})
~~~

## Collision Map Creator Plugin

This is the code for the custom Gazebo-classic world plugin
(`~/collision_map_creator_plugin/collision_map_creator.cc`).

<include src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/osrf/collision_map_creator_plugin/master/collision_map_creator.cc' />


### Code Explained


The necessary system headers to include

~~~
#include <iostream>
#include <math.h>
#include <boost/shared_ptr.hpp>
~~~

These are the necessary Gazebo-classic headers we'll need.

~~~
#include "gazebo/gazebo.hh"
#include "gazebo/common/common.hh"
#include "gazebo/math/Vector3.hh"
#include "gazebo/msgs/msgs.hh"
#include "gazebo/physics/physics.hh"
#include "gazebo/transport/transport.hh"
#include "collision_map_request.pb.h"
~~~

In order to make use of our `collision_map_request` message, we need to
include it's generated header file.

~~~
#include "collision_map_request.pb.h"
~~~

These are used to write a .png file.

~~~
#include <boost/gil/gil_all.hpp>
#include <boost/gil/extension/io/png_dynamic_io.hpp>
~~~

The plugin lives in the gazebo namespace

~~~
namespace gazebo
{
~~~

This is the object that will be sent to our callback method. It's convenient
to create a typedef for it.

~~~
typedef const boost::shared_ptr<const collision_map_creator_msgs::msgs::CollisionMapRequest> CollisionMapRequestPtr;
~~~

Creating a derived class of the Gazebo-classic WorldPlugin. It needs to hold on to
the `NodePtr`, `PublisherPtr`, `SubcriberPtr` and `WorldPtr`, so they must be
added as class variables.

~~~
class CollisionMapCreator : public WorldPlugin
{
  transport::NodePtr node;
  transport::PublisherPtr imagePub;
  transport::SubscriberPtr commandSubscriber;
  physics::WorldPtr world;
~~~

The World Plugin's `Load` method. It sets up the node, the world, the
subscriber and the publisher.

~~~
public: void Load(physics::WorldPtr _parent, sdf::ElementPtr _sdf)
{
  node = transport::NodePtr(new transport::Node());
  world = _parent;
  // Initialize the node with the world name
  node->Init(world->GetName());
  std::cout << "Subscribing to: " << "~/collision_map/command" << std::endl;
~~~

The `node->Subscribe` is called with the topic, callback function, and
a pointer to this plugin object. The `node->Advertise`, requires a template
argument of the message type, and a parameter of the topic to advertise.

~~~
        commandSubscriber = node->Subscribe("~/collision_map/command", &CollisionMapCreator::create, this);
        imagePub = node->Advertise<msgs::Image>("~/collision_map/image");
~~~

This is the callback method. It contains the typedef we used earlier. The
callback is passed a reference, so be sure to use the `&msg`.

~~~
public: void create(CollisionMapRequestPtr &msg)
~~~

The `CollisionMapRequestPtr` is a boost shared_ptr, so to get the actual
fields you need to use a structure de-reference ('->') instead of the
structure reference ('.') like I have below. To get the fields of an object,
you need to call its get function (e.g. `field()`)

~~~
        double z = msg->height();
~~~

But wait you ask, why can you directly reference a subfield? That's because
they aren't shared_ptrs inside, the message we were sent is.

~~~
        double dX_vertical = msg->upperleft().x() - msg->lowerleft().x();
        double dY_vertical = msg->upperleft().y() - msg->lowerleft().y();
        double mag_vertical = sqrt(dX_vertical * dX_vertical + dY_vertical * dY_vertical);
        dX_vertical = msg->resolution() * dX_vertical / mag_vertical;
        dY_vertical = msg->resolution() * dY_vertical / mag_vertical;
~~~


This is an example of how to call the used physics engine to do a single ray
trace. This code was pulled from
`gazebo::physics::World::GetEntityBelowPoint(Vector3)`

~~~
        gazebo::physics::PhysicsEnginePtr engine = world->GetPhysicsEngine();
        engine->InitForThread();
        gazebo::physics::RayShapePtr ray = boost::dynamic_pointer_cast<gazebo::physics::RayShape>(
              engine->CreateShape("ray", gazebo::physics::CollisionPtr()));
~~~


Rasterizing over the grid to determine where there are objects and where
there is not.

~~~
        for (int i = 0; i < count_vertical; ++i)
        {
...
            for (int j = 0; j < count_horizontal; ++j)
            {
...
            }
...
        }
~~~

This creates an Image msg and fills the necessary fields. Notice that the
setter methods for each field is formatted like `set_field(something)`

~~~
        msgs::Image image;
        image.set_width(count_horizontal);
        image.set_height(count_vertical);
        image.set_pixel_format(0);
        image.set_step(count_horizontal);
        image.set_data(data);

        imagePub->Publish(image);
~~~

Register the plugin with the simulator.

~~~
// Register this plugin with the simulator
GZ_REGISTER_WORLD_PLUGIN(CollisionMapCreator)
}
~~~

## Request Publisher Executable

This executable lives outside of gazebo, but it shows how to pull in the
required libraries from Gazebo-classic and publish to gazebo topics with a custom
built message type. There are some extra steps that must be taken that
aren't explained in plugin tutorials. You can see the source code by opening
the file `~/collision_map_creator_plugin/request_publisher.cc`:

<include src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/osrf/collision_map_creator_plugin/master/request_publisher.cc' />

### Code Explained ###

Including necessary standard c++ headers

~~~
#include <iostream>
#include <math.h>
#include <boost/shared_ptr.hpp>
#include <sdf/sdf.hh>
#include <boost/gil/gil_all.hpp>
#include <boost/gil/extension/io/png_dynamic_io.hpp>
~~~

These are the necessary gazebo headers for our executable.

~~~
#include "gazebo/gazebo.hh"
#include "gazebo/common/common.hh"
#include "gazebo/math/Vector3.hh"
#include "gazebo/transport/transport.hh"
#include "gazebo/physics/physics.hh"
#include "gazebo/msgs/msgs.hh"
#include "collision_map_request.pb.h"
~~~

This is the header associated with our custom message types.

~~~
#include "collision_map_request.pb.h"
~~~

This function parses a string of coordinates as defined by
"(x1,y1)(x2,y2)(x3,y3)(x4,y4)" into a deque of Vector2d messages.

~~~
bool createVectorArray(const char * vectorString,
                       deque<gazebo::msgs::Vector2d*> corners)
~~~

Initialize the deque iterator.

~~~
    deque<gazebo::msgs::Vector2d*>::iterator it;
~~~

Iterate through the corners deque

~~~
...
    for (it = corners.begin(); it != corners.end(); ++it)
    {
...
    }
~~~

For this corner Vector2d, we set the X and Y by converting the found string
for each x and y into a float.

~~~
        (*it)->set_x(atof(x.c_str()));
        (*it)->set_y(atof(y.c_str()));
~~~

The main function, which is called when the executable is run.

~~~
int main(int argc, char * argv[])
{
...
}
~~~

This executable requires a number of arguments, only proceed if we at least
four.

~~~
    if (argc > 4)
    {
...
    }
~~~

Create a CollisionMapRequest message. We need to fill this message before
sending it. Also, we initialize a deque of Vector2d messages, so we can pass
them to the `createVectorArray` function.

~~~
        collision_map_creator_msgs::msgs::CollisionMapRequest request;
        deque<gazebo::msgs::Vector2d*> corners;
~~~


If a message field is simple, (double, int32, string) it can be set directly
by its associated `set_field()` method. If the field is a message type
itself, it must be accessed through its `mutable_field()` method. Because the
Vector2d is itself a separate message, we must first get the pointer from
the mutable function call, like we have here.

~~~
        corners.push_back(request.mutable_upperleft());
        corners.push_back(request.mutable_upperright());
        corners.push_back(request.mutable_lowerright());
        corners.push_back(request.mutable_lowerleft());
~~~

Pass the deque of Vector2d pointers and the first argv string to the
`createVectorArray`. If it fails, then the input was probably formatted
incorrectly. Exit the program in this case.

~~~
        if (!createVectorArray(argv[1],corners))
        {
            return -1;
        }
~~~

For the simple fields, we can set their values directly by calling their
`set_field` methods.

~~~
        request.set_height(atof(argv[2]));
        request.set_resolution(atof(argv[3]));
        request.set_filename(argv[4]);
~~~

For our optional threshold field, we set that if it was specified in the
command arguments.

~~~
        if (argc == 6)
        {
            request.set_threshold(atoi(argv[6]));
        }
~~~

This is a super important part of the main method. This initializes the
gazebo transport system. For plugins, Gazebo-classic already takes care of this, but
for our own executable we have to do it ourself. Also notice we're not using
the gazebo namespace so we must be explicit.

~~~
        gazebo::transport::init();
        gazebo::transport::run();
        gazebo::transport::NodePtr node(new gazebo::transport::Node());
        node->Init("default");
~~~

This initializes the Request Publisher on the topic `~/collision_map/command`.

~~~
        gazebo::transport::PublisherPtr imagePub =
                node->Advertise<collision_map_creator_msgs::msgs::CollisionMapRequest>(
                                                            "~/collision_map/command");
~~~

To publish our message, we must first wait for the publisher to be connected
to the master. Then we can directly publish our message.

~~~
        imagePub->WaitForConnection();
        imagePub->Publish(request);
~~~

Before exiting, the program must call `transport::fini()` to tear it all down.

~~~
        gazebo::transport::fini();
~~~


## CMakeLists for Plugin and Executable

Below you can find the CMakeLists.txt file required to compile the plugin
and executable:

<include src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/osrf/collision_map_creator_plugin/master/CMakeLists.txt' />

### Code Explained

Boost is required for in our callback function in the plug-in. Not to
mention, it's also used for the image writer.

~~~
FIND_PACKAGE( Boost 1.40 COMPONENTS system REQUIRED )
~~~

The msgs directory needs to be added to the include directories because we
use them in both the executable and the plugin.

~~~
include_directories(
  ${GAZEBO_INCLUDE_DIRS}
  ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/msgs
  )
~~~

Besides the standard `GAZEBO_LIBRARY_DIRS`, we also need to link against the
msgs directory. The add_subdirectory directive tells CMake to look in it for
a CMakeLists.txt file.

~~~
link_directories(${GAZEBO_LIBRARY_DIRS} ${SDF_LIBRARY_DIRS} ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/msgs)
add_subdirectory(msgs)
~~~

Add the executable `request_publisher` to the makefile. We must link it
against the `collision_map_creator_msgs`, the `GAZEBO_LIBRARIES` and
`Boost_LIBRARIES`. The `add_dependencies` directive tells CMake to build
`collision_map_creator_msgs` first.

~~~
add_executable (request_publisher request_publisher.cc)
target_link_libraries(request_publisher collision_map_creator_msgs ${GAZEBO_LIBRARIES} ${Boost_LIBRARIES} ${SDF_LIBRARIES})
add_dependencies(request_publisher collision_map_creator_msgs)
~~~

This builds our plugin, and is very similar to your standard WorldPlugin
CMakeLists.txt, except we must link it against the
`collision_map_creator_msgs` and add that as a dependency as well.

~~~
add_library(collision_map_creator SHARED collision_map_creator.cc )
target_link_libraries(collision_map_creator collision_map_creator_msgs ${Boost_LIBRARIES} ${GAZEBO_LIBRARIES} ${SDF_LIBRARIES})
add_dependencies(collision_map_creator collision_map_creator_msgs)
~~~

## Build and Deploy ##

First, you will need to install a dependency package, protobuf-compiler.

~~~
sudo apt-get install protobuf-compiler
~~~

To build this project, create a build directory, run CMake and then make.

~~~
cd ~/collision_map_creator_plugin
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make
~~~

This plugin needs to be added to the gazebo plugin path. You can either
change your environment variable to refer to this build directory,

~~~
export GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH=$GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH:collision_map_creator_plugin/build
~~~

or you can copy the plugin to your plugin directory.

~~~
sudo cp libcollision_map_creator.so /usr/lib/gazebo-<YOUR-GAZEBO_VERSION>/plugins/
~~~

## Running

Assuming everything went fine, and that's probably a rough assumption
(seriously this one was long), you need to run Gazebo-classic with a custom world file:

<include src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/osrf/collision_map_creator_plugin/master/map_creator.world' />

Run Gazebo-classic with this world:

~~~
gazebo ~/collision_map_creator_plugin/map_creator.world
~~~

In a separate terminal, run the executable and tell it to build a 20m x 20m
map with a 1cm resolution.

~~~
~/collision_map_creator_plugin/build/request_publisher "(-10,10)(10,10)(10,-10)(-10,-10)" 10 0.01 ~/map.png
~~~

Your executable terminal should show it connecting to Gazebo-classic and display the
request message. You should see your gazebo terminal display some messages
and run a percent complete stat until it finishes. Your map.png should look
like this below.

[[file:files/map.png|800px]]
