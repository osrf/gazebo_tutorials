# Introduction

Interested in developing new features, fixing bugs, or contributing code you
have laying around? Read on to find out how.

## Development process

We follow a development process designed to reduce errors, encourage
collaboration, and make high quality code. The process may seem rigid and
tedious, but every step is worth the effort (especially if you like
applications that work).

### Steps to follow

We will use the Gazebo-classic repository as an example, but the step apply equally
well to other repositories maintained by OSRF.

1. Are you sure?
> Run through this mental checklist before getting started.
>
> 1. Has your idea already been done, or maybe someone is already working on it?
>
>     Check [answers.gazebosim.org](http://answers.gazebosim.org) and the [issue tracker](https://github.com/osrf/gazebo/issues).
>
> 1. Get feedback from the Gazebo-classic core team.
>     Post a topic on [community.gazebosim.org](https://community.gazebosim.org), post a question on [answers.gazebosim.org](http://answers.gazebosim.org), or use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/osrf/gazebo/issues) to get feedback from Gazebo-classic developers.

1. [Fork Gazebo](https://github.com/osrf/gazebo/fork)
> This will create your own personal copy of Gazebo. All of your development should take place in your fork.

1. Work out of a branch: `git checkout -b my_new_branch_name`
> Always work out of a new branch, never off of master. This is a good habit to get in, and will make your life easier.

1. Choose a base branch.
> If your changes will break API or ABI, then base your new branch off of master. If your changes don't break API/ABI and you would like them to be released to an existing gazebo release with major version `N`, then use branch `gazeboN` as the base.

1. Write your code.
> This is the fun part.

1. Write tests.
> A pull request will only be accepted if it has tests. See the `Test coverage` section below for more information.

1. Compiler warnings.
>  Code must have zero compile warnings. This currently only applies to Linux.

1. Style
> A tool is provided in Gazebo-classic (and other repositories) to check for correct style. Your code must have no errors after running the following command from the root of the source tree:
>
> `sh tools/code_check.sh`
>
> The tool does not catch all style errors. See the Style section below for more information.

1. Tests pass
> There must be no failing tests. You can check by running `make test` in your build directory.

1. Documentation.
> Document all your code. Every class, function, member variable must have doxygen comments. All code in source files must have documentation that describes the functionality. This will help reviewers, and future developers.

1. Review your code.
> Before submitting your code through a pull request, take some time to review everything line-by-line. The review process will go much faster if you make sure everything is perfect before other people look at your code. There is a bit of the human-condition involved here. Folks are less likely to spend time reviewing your code if it's bad.

1. Small pull requests
> A large pull request is hard to review, and will take a long time. It is worth your time to split a large pull request into multiple smaller pull requests. For reference, here are a few examples:
>
> [Small, very nice](https://osrf-migration.github.io/gazebo-gh-pages/#!/osrf/gazebo/pull-requests/1732)
>
> [Medium, still okay](https://osrf-migration.github.io/gazebo-gh-pages/#!/osrf/gazebo/pull-requests/1700/)
>
> [Too large](https://osrf-migration.github.io/gazebo-gh-pages/#!/osrf/gazebo/pull-requests/30)

1. [Pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
> Submit a pull request from your GitHub fork when you are ready.

1. Review
> At least two other people have to approve your pull request before it can be merged. Please be responsive to any questions and comments.

1. [Dashboard](http://gazebosim.org/dashboard)
> We have a dashboard that lists all open pull requests. Only pull requests above the green line can be merged, and they must also have at least two approvals.
> We do this to encourage the review of pull requests. If you submit a pull request, then try to review other open pull requests. This will reduce the time it takes for your code to get accepted, and also gets more eyes on more code.

1. Done, phew.
> Once you have met all the requirements, your code will be merged. Thanks for improving Gazebo!

### Internal Developers

This section is targeted mostly for people who have commit access to the main repositories.

In addition to the general development process, please follow these steps
before submitting a pull request. Each step is pass/fail, where the test or
check must pass before continuing to the next step.

1. Test on Windows.
1. Run the style checker on your personal computer.
1. Run all, or only relevant, tests on your personal computer.
1. Run your branch through a jenkins [no-gpu build](http://build.osrfoundation.org/view/gazebo/job/gazebo-any-devel-trusty-amd64-no-gpu/).
1. Run your branch through a jenkins [nvidia build](http://build.osrfoundation.org/view/gazebo/job/gazebo-any-devel-trusty-amd64-gpu-nvidia/).
1. Run your branch through the [ABI/API checker](http://build.osrfoundation.org/view/gazebo/job/gazebo-any_to_any-abichecker-trusty-amd64/), if targeting a release branch.
1. Submit the pull request, and include the following:
  1. Link to a [coverage report](http://build.osrfoundation.org/view/gazebo/job/gazebo-any-coverage-trusty-amd64/).
  1. Link to a passing [homebrew build](http://build.osrfoundation.org/view/gazebo/job/gazebo-any-devel-homebrew-amd64/).
  1. Link to a passing [no-gpu build](http://build.osrfoundation.org/view/gazebo/job/gazebo-any-devel-trusty-amd64-no-gpu/).
  1. Link to a passing [nvidia build](http://build.osrfoundation.org/view/gazebo/job/gazebo-any-devel-trusty-amd64-gpu-nvidia/).
  1. Link to a passing [ABI/API report](http://build.osrfoundation.org/view/gazebo/job/gazebo-any_to_any-abichecker-trusty-amd64/) if the pull request is targeted to a release branch.
  1. A statement that confirms you have tried the code on Windows.
1. A set of jenkins jobs will run automatically once the pull request is created. Reviewers can reference these automatic jobs and the jenkins jobs listed in your pull request.

# Style

In general, we follow [Google's style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html). However, we add in some extras.

1. **This pointer**
> All class attributes and member functions must be accessed using the `this->` pointer. Here is an [example](https://github.com/osrf/gazebo/blob/master/gazebo/physics/Base.cc#L40).

1. **Underscore function parameters**
> All function parameters must start with an underscore. Here is an [example](https://github.com/osrf/gazebo/blob/master/gazebo/physics/Base.cc#L77).

1. **Do not cuddle braces**
> All braces must be on their own line. Here is an [example](https://github.com/osrf/gazebo/blob/master/gazebo/physics/Base.cc#L131).

1. **Multi-line code blocks**
> If a block of code spans multiple lines and is part of a flow control statement, such as an `if`, then it must be wrapped in braces. Here is an [example](https://github.com/osrf/gazebo/blob/master/gazebo/physics/Base.cc#L249)

1. **++ operator**
> This occurs mostly in `for` loops. Prefix the `++` operator, which is [slightly more efficient than postfix in some cases](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/59880/avoid-postfix-increment-operator).

1. **PIMPL/Opaque pointer**
> If you are writing a new class, it must use a private data pointer. Here is an [example](https://github.com/osrf/gazebo/blob/master/gazebo/physics/World.hh), and you can read more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opaque_pointer).

1. **const functions**
> Any class function that does not change a member variable should be marked as `const`. Here is an [example](https://github.com/osrf/gazebo/blob/master/gazebo/physics/Entity.cc).

1. **const parameters**
> All parameters that are not modified by a function should be marked as `const`. This applies to parameters that are passed by reference, pointer, and value. Here is an [example](https://github.com/osrf/gazebo/blob/master/gazebo/physics/Entity.cc).

1. **Pointer and reference variables**
> Place the `*` and `&` next to the varaible name, not next to the type. For example: `int &variable` is good, but `int& variable` is not. Here is an [example](https://github.com/osrf/gazebo/blob/master/gazebo/physics/Entity.cc).

1. **Camel case**
> In general, everything should use camel case. Exceptions include SDF element names, and protobuf variable names. Here is an [example](https://github.com/osrf/gazebo/blob/master/gazebo/physics/Entity.cc).

1. **Class function names**
> Class functions must start with a capital letter, and capitalize every word.
>
> `void MyFunction();` : Allowed
>
> `void myFunction();` : Not Allowed
>
> `void my_function();` : Not Allowed

1. **Variable names**
> Variables must start with a lower case letter, and capitalize every word thereafter.
>
> `int myVariable;` : Allowed
>
> `int myvariable;` : Not Allowed
>
> `int my_variable;` : Not Allowed

1. **No inline comments**
> `//` style comments may not be placed on the same line as code.
>
> `speed *= 0.44704;  // miles per hour to meters per second` : Not Allowed

1. **Accessors must not start with `Get`**
> Member functions granting read access to protected or private data must look like a noun.
>
> `public: ::ServerConfig ServerConfig() const;` : Allowed
>
> `public: ServerConfig GetServerConfig() const;` : Not Allowed
>
> **Corner Cases**
>
> * A class name may conflict with an accessor function. For example, `Model(int)` would conflict with a `Model` class. In these cases, try to follow the `Noun` - `By` pattern. For example:
>
> >  * `ModelByName(const std::string &_name)` : Allowed
> > >  * `ModelById(const int _id)` : Allowed
>
> * A template function that returns a data type may use a stand-alone `Get`. For example:
>
> >  * public: template<typename T> T Get();` : Allowed

1. **Mutators must start with `Set`**
> Member functions granting write access to protected data must begin with `Set`.
>
> `public: void SetServerConfig(ServerConfig &_config);` : Allowed
>
> `public: void ServerConfig(::ServerConfig &_config);` : Not Allowed

# Reduce Code Duplication

Check to make sure someone else is not currently working on the same
feature, before embarking on a project to add something to Gazebo. Simply
send a quick email to the Gazebo-classic mailing list expressing your interest and
idea. Someone will get back to you shortly about your idea.

# Write Tests

All code should have a corresponding unit test. Gazebo-classic uses [GTest](http://code.google.com/p/googletest) for unit testing. All regression test should be placed in `<gazebo_sources>/test/regresssion/`.

Before creating a new regressions test file, check the current test files.
If one closely matches the topic of your new code, simply add a new test
function to the file. Otherwise, create a new test file, and write your
test.

## Test coverage

The goal is to achieve 100% line and branch coverage. However, this is not
always possible due to complexity issues, analysis tools misreporting
coverage, and time constraints. Try to write as complete of a test suite as
possible, and use the coverage analysis tools as guide. If you have trouble
writing a test please ask for help in your pull request.

Gazebo-classic has a build target called `make coverage` that will produce a code coverage report. You'll need [lcov](http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php) and [gcov](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html) installed.

1. In your `build` folder, compile Gazebo-classic and the tests with `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Coverage`

    ~~~
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Coverage ..\
    make
    make tests
    ~~~

1. Run a single test, or all the tests

    ~~~
    make test
    ~~~

1. Make the coverage report

    ~~~
    make coverage
    ~~~

1. View the coverage report

    ~~~
    firefox coverage/index.html
    ~~~


## Gazebo-classic assertions

### What is an assertion?

An assertion is a check, which always produce a boolean result, that
developers place in the code when want to be sure that check is always true.
They are aimed to detect programming errors and should check for impossible
situations in the code. If the assertion check failed, the assertion will
stop the program immediately.

     Object * p = some_crazy_function()
     GZ_ASSERT(p != NULL, "Object from some_crazy_function should never point to NULL")
     p->run()

### Gazebo-classic runtime assertions: GZ_ASSERT

In Gazebo, the GZ_ASSERT macro is designed to handle all our runtime assertions

     GZ_ASSERT(<condition to check>,<fail msg>)

* '''condition-to-check:''' anything returning a boolean value that should always be true.
* '''fail msg:''' message displayed when assertion is thrown

### Benefits of the assertions

Some of the benefits of using the assertions:

* They are really useful for not having to debug all kinds of weird and unexpected errors, especially in runtime. The exact failure point appears when an assertion is triggered.
* The developer can be sure that some conditions are met at a given code point. This makes the code more reliable.
* They help to detect when not-so-obvious errors are happening (affecting performance for example).

### Difference between Assertion and Exception

While assertions are intended for impossible situations resulting from programming errors, exceptions handle all kinds of expected errors and unusual but logically possible code situations.

Let's review an example: suppose we are writing a math library and created a really fast method to calculate square roots, but it only works for positive numbers. Something declared as:

     double sqrt_for_positives(double number)

What could be an assertion and what would be an exception for our revolutionary function?

* Exception: If the incoming number is negative (our function only accepts positive numbers), then we will throw an exception. It was an error by the user, but we should consider it a possible scenario since we are offering a public interface.

* Assertion: Our square root should never return a negative number. This is not a logical error; it is a completely unexpected error which should be impossible if the function is written correctly.

## Debugging Gazebo

### Meaningful backtraces

In order to provide meaningful backtraces when using a debugger, such as GDB, Gazebo-classic should be compiled with debugging support enabled. When using the ubuntu packages, specially the ''-dbg'' package, this support is limited but could be enough in most situations. There are three level of traces which can be obtained:

'''Maximum level of debugging support'''
: This can only be obtained by compiling Gazebo-classic from source and setting the `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` to `DEBUG`. This will set up debugging symbols with no optimizations. It may be required by developers for problems that are especially difficult to track down.

'''Medium level of debugging support'''
: This can be obtained installing the ''gazebo-dbg'' package (since 1.4 version) or compiling Gazebo-classic from source using the `RELWITHDEBINFO` `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` mode (which is the default if no mode is provided). This will set up ''-O2'' optimization level but provide debugging symbols. This should be the default when firing up gdb to explore errors and submit traces.

'''Minimum level of debugging support'''
: This one is present in package versions previous to 1.4 (no ''-dbg'' package present) or compiling Gazebo-classic from source using the `RELEASE` `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` option. This will set up the maximum level of optimizations and does not provide any debugging symbol information. These traces are particularly difficult to follow.

## Code Check

Code pushed into the Gazebo-classic repository should pass a few simple tests. It is also helpful if patches submitted through GitHub pass these tests. Passing these tests is defined as generating no error or warning messages for each of the following tests.

### Regression Tests

In your Gazebo-classic build directory run `make test`:

        make test

All the tests should pass. If they do not, you can run and debug the tests individually. For example, to run the transport test from your build directory:

        ./test/regression/transport

### Static Code Check

Static code checking analyzes your code for bugs, such as potential memory leaks, and style. The Gazebo-classic static code checker uses cppcheck, and a modified cpplint. You'll need to install cppcheck on your system. Ubuntu users can install via:

        sudo apt-get install cppcheck

To check your code, run the following script from the root of the Gazebo-classic sources:

        sh tools/code_check.sh

It takes a few minutes to run. Fix all errors and warnings until the output looks like:

        Total errors found: 0

### `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Check` compiles with no warnings

This test compiles Gazebo-classic with numerous warning flags enabled. The source code for Gazebo-classic should compile cleanly. This does not include code in the `deps` directory. As a rule of thumb, start looking for compilation warnings after the proto messages are built which appear as a series of blue text:

        Linking CXX executable gazebomsgs_out
        Running C++ protocol buffer compiler on axis.proto
        Running C++ protocol buffer compiler on boxgeom.proto
        Running C++ protocol buffer compiler on camerasensor.proto
        Running C++ protocol buffer compiler on collision.proto
        Running C++ protocol buffer compiler on color.proto
        Running C++ protocol buffer compiler on contact.proto
        Running C++ protocol buffer compiler on contacts.proto
