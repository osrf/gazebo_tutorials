# Overview

GzWeb is usually installed on an Ubuntu server. Once the server is set up and running,
clients can interact with the simulation simply by accessing the server's URL
on a web browser.

# Dependencies

The main dependencies for GzWeb are the Gazebo development libraries, version 7 or
greater, and NodeJS version 4 up to version 8.

Take a look at
[these tutorials](http://gazebosim.org/install) to choose the Gazebo
installation that best fits your case. The simplest approach would be
to install Gazebo 7 as follows:

~~~
sudo apt install gazebo7 libgazebo7-dev
~~~

Run the following to install the rest of dependencies, including NodeJS:

~~~
sudo apt install libjansson-dev nodejs npm nodejs-legacy libboost-dev imagemagick libtinyxml-dev mercurial cmake build-essential
~~~

> Ubuntu Trusty comes with NodeJS 0.10. You can follow
  [these](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions) instructions to upgrade
  the Node version.

# Build GzWeb

1. Clone the repository into a directory in your home folder for example:

        cd ~; git clone https://github.com/osrf/gzweb

1. Enter the GzWeb repository and switch to the 1.4.0 release branch:

        cd ~/gzweb
        git checkout gzweb_1.4.0

1. The first time you build, you'll need to gather all the Gazebo models which
   you want to simulate in the right directory ('http/client/assets') and prepare
   them for the web.

    Before running the deploy script, it's important to source the Gazebo
    `setup.sh` file:

    > If you installed gazebo via deb packages:

        source /usr/share/gazebo/setup.sh

    > If you did a source install then:

        source <YOUR_GAZEBO_PATH>/share/gazebo/setup.sh

1. Run the deploy script, this downloads models from the web and may take a
   couple of minutes, see more options below.

        npm run deploy --- -m

    > Note: the `-m` flag tells the deploy script to grab all the models from the
     [model database](https://github.com/osrf/gazebo_models/) and any other
     models in your `GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH`. For all subsequent builds, the `-m` flag
     will not be needed.

## Options

* To skip downloading models from the model database and grab only local models
  in your Gazebo model path, do:

        npm run deploy --- -m local

* To generate thumbnails for all the models , run the script with the `-t` flag, i.e.:

        npm run deploy --- -t

    > Note: This spins up a `gzserver` with a camera for capturing screenshots
    of models. So make sure there is rendering support and no background gzerver
    process running (or set a different `GAZEBO_MASTER_URI` in the terminal).

* If you'll use GzWeb on mobile devices, you can create coarse versions of all
  models, which are lighter to load (50% of original quality). If generated,
  these meshes will automatically be used on mobile devices. If you've already
  ran `npm run deploy --- -m`, run just:

          npm run deploy --- -c

      Or you can run both flags at the same time to generate coarse versions as
      you create the database:

          npm run deploy --- -m -c

      You also have the option to pick specific models and how much percent to
      coarsen, running:

          ./coarse_meshes.sh [percent] [path]

      Here, `[percent]` is the edges ratio with respect to the original mesh
      (0 to 100), and `[path]` is the path of a model. For example:

          ./coarse_meshes.sh 20 http/client/assets/bowl/

# Running

Running GzWeb involves the following pieces:

* `gzserver` running the headless Gazebo simulation (runs by default on
  http://127.0.0.1:11345)

* GzWeb's NodeJS server which communicates with `gzserver` using
  [Gazebo Transport](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=topics_subscribed&cat=transport).
  It works as a bridge between the Javascript and the C++ code.

* An HTTP server which serves static content such as models and website assets
  (icons, HTML, CSS, client-side Javascript...)

* A Websocket server which forwards simulation updates coming from `gzserver`
  to the browser

* A browser client which connects to the HTTP and websocket servers

Start them as follows:

1. On the server machine, start `gazebo` or `gzserver` first, it's recommended
   to run in verbose mode so you see debug messages:

        gzserver --verbose

    > **Tip**: see the port where the Gazebo master is communicating, such as
      `[Msg] Connected to gazebo master @ http://127.0.0.1:11345`

1. On another terminal, from your GzWeb directory, run the following command to
   start both the HTTP and Websocket servers:

        npm start

    > **Tip**: You can use the `-p` option to choose an arbitrary port, for example:
      `npm start -p 1234`. By default, it serves on port 8080.

1. Open a browser that has WebGL and websocket support (i.e. most modern browsers)
   and point it to the IP address and port where the HTTP server is started,
   for example:

        http://localhost:8080

1. To stop `gzserver` or the GzWeb servers, just press `Ctrl+C` in their terminals.

# Troubleshooting

 * **Q: When installing node package modules, I see errors along the lines of:**

        npm ERR! Error: failed to fetch from registry: node-gyp

    A: Try setting the npm registry first then install the modules again.

        npm config set registry http://registry.npmjs.org/

 * **Q: When installing websocket, I see errors along the lines of:**

        sh: 1: node: not found
        npm ERR! error installing websocket@1.0.8
        npm WARN This failure might be due to the use of legacy binary "node"

    **Or along the lines of:**

        /usr/bin/env: node: No such file or directory
        There are node-gyp build errors, exiting.

    A: In Debian systems, the binary file "node" has been renamed to "nodejs" to avoid a name conflict. Try adding a symlink to the correct name:

        sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node

    You may also find that your repository is too old and you should just install recent versions of node and npm directly.

 * **Q: When running `npm run deploy ---`, I see errors along the lines of:**

        gyp ERR! configure error

    A: There might be a conflict between the gyp version installed and the gyp version in node-gyp. Try removing gyp:

        sudo apt-get remove gyp

 * **Q: When running `npm run deploy ---`, I have problems finding GTS, like this:**

        ~/gzweb/tools/gzcoarse.cc:18:17: fatal error: gts.h : no such file or directory, #include <gts.h>

    A: It seems that your Gazebo installation didn't install GTS headers. Try installing them manually:

        sudo apt-get install libgts-dev
