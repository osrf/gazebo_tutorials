# Intro

Welcome to the Beginner Module! This module will guide you through the most
basic features of Gazebo, with each tutorial building upon the last. We
recommend following the tutorials in order. 

These tutorials are intended for those new to Gazebo-classic and/or folks with **no programming or Linux experience**.

# What is Gazebo? #

Gazebo-classic is a 3D dynamic simulator with the ability to accurately and
efficiently simulate populations of robots in complex indoor and outdoor
environments. While similar to game engines, Gazebo-classic offers physics
simulation at a much higher degree of fidelity, a suite of sensors, and
interfaces for both users and programs.

Typical uses of Gazebo-classic include:

* testing robotics algorithms,

* designing robots,

* performing regression testing with realistic scenarios

A few key features of Gazebo-classic include: 

* multiple physics engines,

* a rich library of robot models and environments,
 
* a wide variety of sensors,

* convenient programmatic and graphical interfaces

# System requirements #

Gazebo-classic is currently best used on [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/download), a flavor of [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux). You will need a computer that has:

* A dedicated [GPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit),
 * Nvidia cards tend to work well in Ubuntu
* A CPU that is at least an Intel I5, or equivalent,
* At least 500MB of free disk space,
* Ubuntu Trusty or later installed.

# Installation Instructions for Ubuntu #

1. Download the [installer](http://osrf-distributions.s3.amazonaws.com/gazebo/gazebo6_install.sh).

    ```
    chmod +x ~/Downloads/gazebo6_install.sh
    ```

1. Press Alt-F2
  * A window with a prompt should appear in the upper left

1. Press Ctrl-V, and press Enter
  * The window will disappear
 
1. Copy in the following:

    ```
