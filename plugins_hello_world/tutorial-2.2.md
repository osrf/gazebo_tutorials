# Overview of Gazebo-classic Plugins

A plugin is a chunk of code that is compiled as a shared library and inserted into the simulation.
The plugin has direct access to all the functionality of Gazebo-classic through the standard C++ classes.

Plugins are useful because they:

* let developers control almost any aspect of Gazebo
* are self-contained routines that are easily shared
* can be inserted and removed from a running system

Previous versions of Gazebo-classic utilized controllers.
These behaved in much the same way as plugins, but were statically compiled into Gazebo.
Plugins are more flexible, and allow users to pick and choose what functionality to
include in their simulations.

You should use a plugin when:

*  you want to programmatically alter a simulation

   Ex: move models, respond to events, insert new models given a set of preconditions
   
*  you want a fast interface to gazebo, without the overhead of the transport layer

   Ex: No serialization and deserialization of messages.
   
*  you have some code that could benefit others and want to share it

# Plugin Types

There are currently 5 types of plugins

1.  World
1.  Model
1.  Sensor
1.  System.
1.  Visual.

Each plugin type is managed by a different component of Gazebo.
For example, a Model plugin is attached to and controls a specific model in Gazebo.
Similarly, a World plugin is attached to a world, and a Sensor plugin to a specific sensor.
The System plugin is specified on the command line, and loads first during a Gazebo-classic startup.
This plugin gives the user control over the startup process.

A plugin type should be chosen based on the desired functionality.
Use a World plugin to control world properties, such as the physics engine, ambient lighting, etc.
Use a Model plugin to control joints, and state of a model.
Use a Sensor plugin to acquire sensor information and control sensor properties.

# Hello WorldPlugin!

Plugins are designed to be simple.
A bare bones world plugin contains a class with a few member functions.

First, if you installed Gazebo-classic from debians, make sure you've installed the Gazebo-classic development files. If you installed Gazebo-classic from source, you can ignore this step. If you have a lower release than gazebo5, replace 5 with whatever version number you have.

~~~
sudo apt-get install libgazebo5-dev
~~~

Next, make a directory and a .cc file for the new plugin:

~~~
$ mkdir ~/gazebo_plugin_tutorial
$ cd ~/gazebo_plugin_tutorial
$ gedit hello_world.cc
~~~

Copy the following into hello_world.cc:
<include from='/#include/' src='http://github.com/osrf/gazebo/raw/gazebo_2.2/examples/plugins/hello_world/hello_world.cc' />

The above code is also located in the Gazebo-classic sources:
[examples/plugins/hello\_world/hello\_world.cc](http://github.com/osrf/gazebo/blob/gazebo_2.2/examples/plugins/hello_world),
along with an appropriate CMakeLists.txt file.

## Code Explained

~~~
#include <gazebo/gazebo.hh>

namespace gazebo
{
~~~

The [gazebo/gazebo.hh](https://github.com/osrf/gazebo/blob/gazebo_2.2/gazebo/gazebo_core.hh)
file includes a core set of basic gazebo functions.
It doesn't include `gazebo/physics/physics.hh`, `gazebo/rendering/rendering.hh`,
or `gazebo/sensors/sensors.hh` as those should be included on a case by case basis.
All plugins must be in the `gazebo` namespace.

~~~
  class WorldPluginTutorial : public WorldPlugin
  {
    public: WorldPluginTutorial() : WorldPlugin()
            {
              printf("Hello World!\n");
            }
~~~

Each plugin must inherit from a plugin type, which in this case is the `WorldPlugin` class.

~~~
    public: void Load(physics::WorldPtr _world, sdf::ElementPtr _sdf)
            {
            }
~~~

The only other mandatory function is `Load` which receives an SDF element that
contains the elements and attributes specified in loaded SDF file.

~~~
  GZ_REGISTER_WORLD_PLUGIN(WorldPluginTutorial)
~~~

Finally, the plugin must be registered with the simulator using the
`GZ_REGISTER_WORLD_PLUGIN` macro.
The only parameter to this macro is the name of the plugin class.
There are matching register macros for each plugin type:
`GZ_REGISTER_MODEL_PLUGIN`, `GZ_REGISTER_SENSOR_PLUGIN`,
`GZ_REGISTER_SYSTEM_PLUGIN` and `GZ_REGISTER_VISUAL_PLUGIN`.

The following section contains instructions on how to compile this plugin.

## Compiling the Plugin

Please make sure that gazebo has been properly [installed](http://gazebosim.org/#download).

To compile the above plugin, create `~/gazebo_plugin_tutorial/CMakeLists.txt`:

~~~
$ gedit ~/gazebo_plugin_tutorial/CMakeLists.txt
~~~

Copy the following in CMakeLists.txt:
<include src='http://github.com/osrf/gazebo/raw/gazebo_2.2/examples/plugins/hello_world/CMakeLists.txt' />

Create the build directory

~~~
$ mkdir ~/gazebo_plugin_tutorial/build
$ cd ~/gazebo_plugin_tutorial/build
~~~

Compile the code.

~~~
$ cmake ../
$ make
~~~

Compiling will result in a shared library,
`~/gazebo_plugin_tutorial/build/libhello_world.so`,
that can be inserted in a Gazebo-classic simulation.

Lastly, add your library path to the `GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH`:

~~~
$ export GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH=${GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH}:~/gazebo_plugin_tutorial/build
~~~

# Using a Plugin

Once you have a plugin compiled as a shared library (see above),
you can attach it to a world or model in an SDF file
(see [SDF documentation](http://gazebosim.org/sdf.html) for more info).
On startup, Gazebo-classic parses the SDF file, locates the plugin, and loads the code.
It is important that Gazebo-classic is capable of finding the plugin.
Either the full path to the plugin is specified, or the plugin exists in
one of the paths in the `GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH` environment variable.

Example world file also found in
[examples/plugins/hello_world/hello.world](https://github.com/osrf/gazebo/blob/gazebo_2.2/examples/plugins/hello_world/hello.world).
<include src='http://github.com/osrf/gazebo/raw/gazebo_2.2/examples/plugins/hello_world/hello.world' />

Make a copy of the file in `~/gazebo_plugin_tutorial/hello.world`
and open it with `gzserver`:

~~~
$ gzserver ~/gazebo_plugin_tutorial/hello.world --verbose
~~~

You should see output similar to:
