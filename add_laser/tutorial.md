# Overview

**Prerequisites:** [Attach a Mesh as Visual](/tutorials/?tut=attach_meshes)

This tutorials demonstrates how the user can create composite models directly
from other models in the
[Gazebo Model Database](https://github.com/osrf/gazebo_models)
by using the
[\<include\>](http://sdformat.org/spec?ver=1.5&elem=world#world_include)
tags and
[\<joint\>](http://sdformat.org/spec?ver=1.5&elem=joint)
to connect different components of a composite model.

## Adding a Laser

Adding a laser to a robot, or any model, is simply a matter of including the sensor in the model.

1.  Go into your model directory from the previous tutorial:

        cd ~/.gazebo/models/my_robot

1.  Open `model.sdf` in your favorite editor.

1.  Add the following lines directly before the `</model>` tag near the end of the file.

    ~~~
        <include>
          <uri>model://hokuyo</uri>
          <pose>0.2 0 0.2 0 0 0</pose>
        </include>
        <joint name="hokuyo_joint" type="revolute">
          <child>hokuyo::link</child>
          <parent>chassis</parent>
          <axis>
            <xyz>0 0 1</xyz>
            <limit>
              <upper>0</upper>
              <lower>0</lower>
            </limit>
          </axis>
        </joint>
    ~~~

    The `<include>` block tells Gazebo to find a model, and insert it at a
    given `<pose>` relative to the parent model. In this case we place the
    hokuyo laser forward and above the robot.  The `<uri>` block tells gazebo
    where to find the model inside its model database (note, you can see a
    listing of the model database uri used by these tutorials
    [here](http://models.gazebosim.org/), and at the corresponding [git
    repository](https://github.com/osrf/gazebo_models)).

    The new `<joint>` connects the inserted hokuyo laser onto the chassis of the robot. The joint has and `<upper>` and `<lower>` limit of zero to prevent it from moving.

    The `<child>` name in the joint is derived from the [hokuyo model's SDF](https://github.com/osrf/gazebo_models/blob/master/hokuyo/model.sdf), which begins with:

    %%%
        <?xml version="1.0" ?>
        <sdf version="1.4">
          <model name="hokuyo">
            <link name="link">
    %%%

    When the hokuyo model is inserted, the hokuyo's links are namespaced with their model name. In this case the model name is `hokuyo`, so each link in the hokuyo model is prefaced with `hokuyo::`.

1.  Now start gazebo, and add the robot to the simulation using the Insert tab on the GUI. You should see the robot with a laser attached.

1.  (Optional)  Try adding a camera to the robot. The camera's model URI is `model://camera`, it should have been locally caches for you in:

        ls ~/.gazebo/models/camera/


    For reference, the SDF documentation can be found [here](http://gazebosim.org/sdf/).
