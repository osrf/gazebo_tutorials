# Introduction

The set of ROS 2 packages for interfacing with Gazebo are contained within a
meta package named `gazebo_ros_pkgs`.
See
[ROS 2 Overview](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials/?tut=ros2_overview)
for background information before continuing here.

The packages support ROS 2 Crystal and later and Gazebo 9 and later, and can be installed from
debian packages or from source.

## Prerequisites

You should understand the basic concepts of ROS 2 and have gone through some
[ROS 2 Tutorials](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Tutorials).

### Install ROS 2

ROS2 can be installed either through binary installation or source installation,
see the [ROS 2 installation page](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Installation).
The current stable distribution is **Foxy**.

> **Tip**: Don't forget to source `setup.bash` script as instructed
  on the ROS installation page. The exact command will be different according to
  the installation method.

### Install Gazebo

You can install Gazebo either from source or from pre-build packages. See
[Install Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?cat=install).

You should install Gazebo 9 or later. If installing from source, be sure to build the
appropriate branch, such as `gazebo11` for Gazebo 11.

> **Tip**: You may need to source Gazebo's setup file if you're having difficulty
finding plugins and other resources. For example: `source /usr/share/gazebo/setup.sh`.

## Install gazebo\_ros\_pkgs

Follow either the instructions to install from debian packages, or the
instructions to install from source.

### Install from debian packages (on Ubuntu)

Assuming you already have some Foxy debian packages installed, install
`gazebo_ros_pkgs` as follows:

    sudo apt install ros-foxy-gazebo-ros-pkgs

### Install from source (on Ubuntu)

If you are an active developer setting up to contribute to the
code base, it is advisable to have the source installation, as it provides more
access and control over the workflow.

> **Tip**: These instructions require the use of the
  [colcon](https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/) build tool, which is the
  standard tool used in ROS 2.

You'll need to choose the branch of `gazebo_ros_pkgs` according to the
ROS 2 version you're using. The currently supported branches are:

* `dashing`: works with Dashing debians or Dashing's
  [ros2.repos](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros2/ros2/dashing/ros2.repos).
* `eloquent`: works with Eloquent debians or Eloquent's
  [ros2.repos](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros2/ros2/eloquent/ros2.repos).
* `ros2`: points to the next unreleased ROS 2 turtle, currently Foxy.
  It works with the master
  [ros2.repos](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros2/ros2/master/ros2.repos).

The following setup assumes installation with `ros2` branch of `gazebo_ros_pkgs`.

1. Make sure `git` is installed on your Ubuntu machine:

        sudo apt install git

1. Create a directory for the colcon workspace and move into it:

        mkdir -p ~/ws/src

1. Copy
  [this file](https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/blob/ros2/gazebo_ros_pkgs.repos),
  that gets `gazebo_ros_pkgs` and additional packages needed:

        cd ~/ws
        wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/ros2/gazebo_ros_pkgs.repos

    > **Note:** The `version` tag in the yaml file indicates the branch we are
      checking out for a particular repository e.g.
      `version: ros2` checks out the `ros2` branch.

1. Get the packages into the `src` directory

        cd ~/ws
        vcs import src < gazebo_ros_pkgs.repos

1. Switch to the branch matching your ROS distro

        vcs custom --args checkout foxy

1. Install all dependencies:

        cd ~/ws
        rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y

1. Then build all the packages:

        cd ~/ws
        colcon build --symlink-install

    > **Note:** Before building this ensure that the ROS 2 environment is sourced
    correctly.

1. If you've had any problems building, be sure to ask for help at
   [answers.gazebosim.org](http://answers.gazebosim.org/questions/).

1. Be sure to source this workspace's install setup for every new terminal
   you open:

        source ~/ws/install/setup.bash

    > **Tip**: You can make this be automatically sourced for every new terminal
      by running this once: `echo "source ~/ws/install/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc`

## Testing Gazebo and ROS 2 integration

Assuming your ROS 2 and Gazebo environments have been properly setup and built,
you should now be able to load Gazebo worlds which contain ROS 2 plugins, and to
insert models at runtime which have ROS 2 plugins in them.

Gazebo ROS packages provides several demo worlds for you to get a quick start
with the plugins. The demo worlds can be found
[here](https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/tree/ros2/gazebo_plugins/worlds),
and are installed by default under
`/opt/ros/<distro>/share/gazebo_plugins/worlds/`.

Each world file comes with instructions at the top with some example commands
that you can run to test its functionality, be sure to check that out!

Let's try loading one of them now!

1. Open a new terminal

1. Source  ROS 2 as instructed when you installed ROS 2.

1. Make sure you have some core tools installed:

        sudo apt install ros-foxy-ros-core ros-foxy-geometry2

1. If you installed `gazebo_ros_pkgs` from source, source the workspace:

        . ~/ws/install/setup.bash

1. Load the differential drive world with Gazebo:

        gazebo --verbose /opt/ros/foxy/share/gazebo_plugins/worlds/gazebo_ros_diff_drive_demo.world

1. The Gazebo GUI should appear with a simple vehicle:

    [[file:figs/gazebo_ros_diff_drive.png|600px]]

1. On a new terminal (this is the 2nd one), run the following command to take a
   look at the world file.

        gedit /opt/ros/foxy/share/gazebo_plugins/worlds/gazebo_ros_diff_drive_demo.world

1. See how the block on the top has a few example commands? Let's open a 3rd
   terminal and, again, source ROS 2 and `gazebo_ros_pkgs` as described above.

1. Then run one of the commands, for example:

        ros2 topic pub /demo/cmd_demo geometry_msgs/Twist '{linear: {x: 1.0}}' -1

1. You'll see the vehicle moving forward:

    [[file:figs/gazebo_ros_diff_drive_lin_vel.gif|600px]]

1. Try out the other commands listed on the file, and try mofidying their
   values to get a feeling of how things work. Also try out other demo worlds!
